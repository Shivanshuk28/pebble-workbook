You need to find the atomic block the given element belongs to 
you are given with the atomic number of element and  need to return its block {'s','p','d','f'}.

Block is determined by the letter of the last subshell in which the last electron is placed.

If the last electron goes into an s-orbital -> s (block)
If the last electron goes into a p-orbital -> p (block)
If the last electron goes into a d-orbital -> d (block)
If the last electron goes into an f-orbital -> f (block)

Block is found by simulating the Aufbau principle
{Note:in Aufabu priciple electrons are filled in  increasing order of the atomic orbits}
Prerequisite:
orbital order is 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p
and capacity of each is s:2, p:6, d:10, f:14

ex:
 ex1:Atomic number Z = 11.
	explanation:1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s¹
	Output: s-block
ex2: Atomic number Z = 21
	explanation: 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p⁶ 4s² 3d¹
	output: d-block

You're right to ask for edge cases! For a problem like this, edge cases often live at the "boundaries" of the counting system or where one component "rolls over" and affects the next.

Here are the key edge cases for the `getVehicleIndexNumber` function, along with their expected outputs and why they are important:

### Edge Cases for `getVehicleIndexNumber`

These cases test the function's behavior at the minimum, maximum, and transition points of the numbering system.

1.  **Absolute Minimum:**
    *   **LRN:** `AA0001`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** This is the very first car in the registry. It tests that the 1-based indexing is correctly handled and that no "completed block" counts are incorrectly added when starting from scratch.
    *   **Expected Output:** `1`

2.  **Absolute Maximum:**
    *   **LRN:** `ZZ9999`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** This is the very last possible car. It tests the calculation for the largest possible `L1` and `L2` indices, combined with the largest `NNNN` value.
    *   **Expected Output:** `26 * 26 * 9999 = 6759324`

3.  **Numerical Part Maximum (before second letter rollover):**
    *   **LRN:** `AA9999`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** This is the last car for a given two-letter prefix (`AA`). It tests that the `NNNN` part correctly reaches its maximum before the next component (`L2`) increments.
    *   **Expected Output:** `9999`

4.  **Second Letter Rollover (after numerical part maximum):**
    *   **LRN:** `AB0001`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** This is the first car *after* `AA9999`. It tests the transition where the second letter increments, and the numerical part resets to `0001`.
    *   **Expected Output:** `10000` (`9999` from `AA` + `1` from `AB0001`)

5.  **Second Letter Maximum (before first letter rollover):**
    *   **LRN:** `AZ9999`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** This is the last car for a given *first letter* block (`A`). It tests that all 26 possible second letters (A-Z) have been accounted for, each with their `9999` numerical values.
    *   **Expected Output:** `26 * 9999 = 259974`

6.  **First Letter Rollover (after second letter maximum):**
    *   **LRN:** `BA0001`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** This is the first car *after* `AZ9999`. It tests the critical transition where the first letter increments, and both the second letter and numerical part reset to their minimums.
    *   **Expected Output:** `259975` (`259974` from `A` block + `1` from `BA0001`)

7.  **Mid-range, First Letter Changes, Second Letter is 'A':**
    *   **LRN:** `CA0001`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** Similar to `BA0001`, but for a letter further down the alphabet. It confirms the `L1` block calculation is correct for non-initial letters.
    *   **Expected Output:** `2 * (26 * 9999) + 1 = 519948 + 1 = 519949`

8.  **Mid-range, First Letter 'A', Second Letter is 'Z', but Numerical is Small:**
    *   **LRN:** `AZ0001`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** This is the *start* of the final second-letter block within the first-letter prefix. It ensures the calculation correctly accounts for all preceding `L2` blocks but not the full `L2` block yet.
    *   **Expected Output:** `25 * 9999 + 1 = 249975 + 1 = 249976`

9.  **Mid-range, Second Letter is 'A', Numerical is High:**
    *   **LRN:** `BA9999`
    *   **Why it's an edge case:** Tests the highest numerical value within a new first-letter block where the second letter is at its minimum.
    *   **Expected Output:** `1 * (26 * 9999) + 9999 = 259974 + 9999 = 269973`

These edge cases, when tested, thoroughly validate the logic of the solution.

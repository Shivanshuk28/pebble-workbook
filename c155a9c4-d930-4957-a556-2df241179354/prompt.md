Of course. Here is the same coding challenge presented in a crisp, markdown docstring format, perfect for including directly in your code.

```python
def find_faulty_servers(status_codes):
    """Identifies the indices of faulty servers from a list of status codes.

    A server is considered **faulty** if its HTTP status code is in the
    500-599 range (a server-side error). This function iterates through
    the list and returns the positions of all such faulty servers.

    Args:
        status_codes (list[int]): A list of HTTP status codes, where each
            index corresponds to a server's slot number.

    Returns:
        list[int]: A list containing the indices of the faulty servers.
        Returns an empty list `[]` if no servers are faulty.

    Example:
        >>> status_codes = [200, 200, 503, 204, 500]
        >>> find_faulty_servers(status_codes)
        [2, 4]

        >>> stable_codes = [200, 404, 201, 400]
        >>> find_faulty_servers(stable_codes)
        []
    """
    # Function implementation goes here
    pass
```

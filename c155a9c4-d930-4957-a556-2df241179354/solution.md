Of course. Here are a few different solutions in Python for the "Faulty Server Locator" problem, each with explanations of its approach.

### Solution 1: Using a Standard `for` Loop with `enumerate`

This is the most common and readable approach for beginners. It explicitly loops through the list, checks each item, and builds a result list.

```python
def find_faulty_servers(status_codes):
    """
    Identifies the indices of faulty servers from a list of status codes.

    A server is considered **faulty** if its HTTP status code is in the
    500-599 range (a server-side error). This function iterates through
    the list and returns the positions of all such faulty servers.

    Args:
        status_codes (list[int]): A list of HTTP status codes, where each
            index corresponds to a server's slot number.

    Returns:
        list[int]: A list containing the indices of the faulty servers.
        Returns an empty list `[]` if no servers are faulty.
    """
    # Create an empty list to store the indices of faulty servers.
    faulty_indices = []

    # Use enumerate to get both the index and the value for each item.
    for index, code in enumerate(status_codes):
        # Check if the code is within the server error range (500-599).
        if 500 <= code <= 599:
            # If it is, add its index to our list.
            faulty_indices.append(index)

    return faulty_indices

# --- Examples ---
print(f"Example 1: {find_faulty_servers([200, 200, 503, 204, 500])}")  # Expected: [2, 4]
print(f"Example 2: {find_faulty_servers([200, 404, 201, 400])}")      # Expected: []
print(f"Example 3: {find_faulty_servers([502, 200, 301, 504, 500])}")  # Expected: [0, 3, 4]
print(f"Empty list test: {find_faulty_servers([])}")                   # Expected: []
```

### Solution 2: Using a List Comprehension (More "Pythonic")

This is a more concise and efficient way to write the same logic in Python. It builds the new list in a single, expressive line of code.

```python
def find_faulty_servers_comprehension(status_codes):
    """
    Identifies the indices of faulty servers using a list comprehension.
    This is a more compact and often faster way to achieve the same result.
    """
    return [
        index for index, code in enumerate(status_codes) if 500 <= code <= 599
    ]

# --- Examples ---
print("\n--- Using List Comprehension ---")
print(f"Example 1: {find_faulty_servers_comprehension([200, 200, 503, 204, 500])}")
print(f"Example 2: {find_faulty_servers_comprehension([200, 404, 201, 400])}")
print(f"Example 3: {find_faulty_servers_comprehension([502, 200, 301, 504, 500])}")
```

### Explanation of Approaches

*   **Solution 1 (Standard `for` loop):**
    *   **Clarity:** This method is very explicit and easy to follow step-by-step, making it great for readability and for situations where more complex logic might be needed inside the loop.
    *   **`enumerate()`:** This built-in Python function is key. It takes a list and returns pairs of `(index, value)`, which is exactly what we need for this problem.

*   **Solution 2 (List Comprehension):**
    *   **Conciseness:** This is the preferred method in the Python community for filtering and transforming lists. It reads almost like a sentence: "Create a list of *indices* for each *index, code* pair in the *enumerated status codes* if the *code is a server error*."
    *   **Performance:** List comprehensions are often slightly faster than a standard `for` loop that appends to a list, as the list's size can be better optimized during creation.

For this specific problem, both solutions are excellent, but the **list comprehension (Solution 2)** is generally considered the best practice.

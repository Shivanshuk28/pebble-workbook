Of course. Here is a detailed breakdown of the normal cases, edge cases, and robustness checks for the "Faulty Server Locator" problem. This is a crucial part of software developmentâ€”thinking about what could go wrong is just as important as writing the code for what should go right.

### Normal Test Cases (The "Happy Path")

These cases test the primary, expected functionality of the program. A correct solution must pass all of these.

**1. A Mix of Good and Faulty Servers**
*   **Case:** The input contains a typical mix of working servers (`2xx` codes) and faulty servers (`5xx` codes). This is the most standard scenario.
*   **Input:** `[200, 201, 503, 404, 204, 500]`
*   **Reasoning:** Tests the core logic. It should correctly identify the `5xx` codes while ignoring `2xx` and `4xx` codes. The `404` is important to include to ensure client-side errors aren't flagged.
*   **Expected Output:** `[2, 5]`

**2. Only Faulty Servers**
*   **Case:** Every server in the rack has failed.
*   **Input:** `[500, 501, 502, 503]`
*   **Reasoning:** Ensures the logic works correctly when every single item in the list meets the condition.
*   **Expected Output:** `[0, 1, 2, 3]`

**3. Faulty Servers at the Beginning and End**
*   **Case:** The faulty servers are the very first and very last items in the list.
*   **Input:** `[502, 200, 201, 302, 504]`
*   **Reasoning:** This checks for "off-by-one" errors and ensures the loop correctly handles the boundaries of the list (index `0` and index `len(list) - 1`).
*   **Expected Output:** `[0, 4]`

### Edge Cases

These cases test the boundaries, limits, and unusual (but valid) conditions of the problem. A robust solution should handle these gracefully.

**1. No Faulty Servers**
*   **Case:** All servers are functioning correctly or have non-server errors.
*   **Input:** `[200, 201, 404, 301, 204]`
*   **Reasoning:** This is a critical edge case. The program must return an empty list and not crash or return `None`. It tests the "no matches found" scenario.
*   **Expected Output:** `[]`

**2. Empty Input List**
*   **Case:** The health-check script returns an empty list, perhaps because the rack is offline or has no servers.
*   **Input:** `[]`
*   **Reasoning:** This is the ultimate boundary test. The code should not throw an error when given an empty list. It should simply do nothing and return an empty list.
*   **Expected Output:** `[]`

**3. Boundary Value Codes**
*   **Case:** The input includes status codes that are exactly on or just outside the boundaries of the "faulty" range (`500`-`599`).
*   **Input:** `[499, 500, 599, 600]`
*   **Reasoning:** This directly tests the conditional logic (`>= 500 and <= 599`). It's very easy to make a mistake with `>` vs `>=` or `<` vs `<=`. This test will catch that.
*   **Expected Output:** `[1, 2]`

**4. Large Input List**
*   **Case:** The input list is very long, simulating a large data center.
*   **Input:** A list with 10,000 status codes, with a few `5xx` codes scattered within.
*   **Reasoning:** This is a performance consideration. While the simple loop solution is efficient enough (`O(n)`), it's good practice to consider how the code would perform at scale. The logic should not change.
*   **Expected Output:** A list of the correct indices, however many there are.

### Robustness / Invalid Input Checks

These cases are technically outside the problem's strict definition ("a list of integers"), but a truly production-ready function would consider them.

**1. List with Non-Integer Data Types**
*   **Case:** The data is corrupted and contains strings or other types.
*   **Input:** `[200, 503, "error", 404]`
*   **Reasoning:** What should happen? In most languages (like Python), comparing a string to an integer (`"error" >= 500`) will raise a `TypeError`. A robust function might use a `try-except` block to ignore invalid entries.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The function should ideally not crash. It could either ignore the bad data (`return [1]`) or raise a more specific error.

**2. Input is Not a List**
*   **Case:** The function is called with the wrong type of argument entirely.
*   **Input:** `find_faulty_servers(503)` or `find_faulty_servers("all good")`
*   **Reasoning:** The function expects an iterable list. Calling it with a single integer or a string will cause a `TypeError`. A production function should validate its input types.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The function should fail, but ideally with a clear error message (e.g., `TypeError: Input must be a list`).
